    "Computers - as we have previously observerd - aren't terribly smart. While we are able to represent information like \"Hello\" and \"3.14159\", it's pretty clear that the things we might do with the value of Pi and a greeting are pretty different. It's hard to divide two strings, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to remove the apostrophies from an integer. In fact, internally, Python has the ability to represent these data very differently. Each kind of data is called a \"Type\". Soon, we will work directly with types, but the important thing to know for now is that they exist, and that every kind of data is of a \"Type\". Here are the basics (and, in parenthesis, some synonyms/similar types):\n",

    " * Float (double)\n",
