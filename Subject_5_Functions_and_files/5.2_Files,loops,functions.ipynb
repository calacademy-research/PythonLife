    "\n",
    "A **filehandle** is an object that controls the stream of information between your program and a file stored somewhere on the computer. Filehandles are not filenames, and they are not the files themselves. Like variables, filehandles contain the address of the file on the hard drive or other storage media. But unlike variables, filehandles also keep track of your current read position in the file. Imagine your file is like a book in a library. The filehandle tells Python where that book is, and keeps a bookmark in the book for where you currently are. Because filehandles are not the files themselves, deleting a filehandle in your script using the **del** command does nothing to the file to which the filehandle refers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create filehandles in the simplest sense with the **open()** command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fh = open('some_file')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where some_file is the path to a file (i.e. the filename) on your filesystem. In general, it is good practice to use absolute path nomenclature (e.g. /Users/aaron/some_file or /home/aaron/some_file), but you can be lazy if you know the file you want is going to be in the same directory as your program."
