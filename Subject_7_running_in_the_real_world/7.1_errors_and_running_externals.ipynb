    "# System Calls With the subprocess Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will cover how to use the **subprocess** module to interact with other software, making system calls, collecting data, and automating your entire analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bioinformatics we will often want to use other peoples software, whether that's Python packages like Biopython or packages written in other languages, like the highly efficient C. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we use many specialized packages to quickly and easily perform tasks such as alignment, SNP calling, or phylogenetics. Even simple Unix tools like **wc** can be useful to count the number of genes in a GFF file or length of a FASTA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bioinformatics tools, like Unix tools, are run through the command line. Given that you might want to repeat an analysis using some of these tools on, for example, hundreds of genes, manually entering the commands for your entire pipeline is not only boring and error prone but a waste of your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will teach you to automate your pipeline by using Python to run these command line tools for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Advantages to Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproducability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the greatest advantage to a scientist in automating analysis is that the analysis can be reproduced exactly. Your exact methods are laid out in your Python script, where you and others can scrutinize, repeat, and modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Less Tedium**\n",
    "\n",
    "From printing out the name of every gene expressed over a certain level, to BLASTING those genes against the NCBI database, to sorting and counting the resulting hits, scripting saves you a huge amount of tedious labor. Nobody wants to type, or even copy and paste, hundreds of BLAST queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as being incredibly mind-numbing, manually running bioinformatics tools is dangerous. What if you accidentally type 'Gasterosteus_aculeatus_CA_SNPs.vcf' instead of 'Gasterosteus_aculeatus_AC_SNPs.vcf', accidentally substituting your California population for your Atlantic Coast population? Or 'clean_reads.py expensive_dataset.fq > expensive_dataset.fq' instead of 'clean_reads.py expensive_dataset.fq > expensive_dataset.clean.fq'? There are *thousands* of ways you can accidentally screw up your analysis to either ruin your day or produce erroneous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation reduces the risk of stupid typos and other accidents. You won't forget to include mydata.part.14.bam in the analysis when you run **results = [analyse(data) for data in mydata]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallelization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern computers, even budget laptops, now have multiple processors, which means you can run several or even hundreds of analyses at once (if you have access to a supercomputing cluster)! Python provides a number of tools to help you manage these processes and make the most out of parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",

The __shell__ keyword argument we will leave as __True__ for this tutorial. Without it, the process is created directly by the operating system, and any symbols or commands that the shell would recognize (e.g. spaces, \">\", and \"|\") result in an error. Because spaces are a symbol recognized by the shell, when calling __call()__ without __shell=True__, the first argument should be a list of command line arguments that would be separated by spaces spaces on the terminal. So **ls -a -1 /home/james** would become **['ls', '-a', '-1', '/home/james']**."
