    "# Welcome to the CCG's Science Coding Course Series,\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your instructors are: Joe Russack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Welcome to Science Coding Courses!\n",
    "- What is Python? Why it is useful?\n",
    "- Launching Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Running simple programs in Python using UNIX commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Schedule\n",
    "TBA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are you going to learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this  class, you will embark on a journey to learn the fundamentals of one of the world's most popular and versatile programming languages. We will learn how to leverage Python's interactive shell and write code that can be executed from the command line. The course will cover essential concepts such as variables, data types, and basic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a subsequent module, we will be progressing to more complex topics like control structures (if-else statements, loops) and functions. There we will also explore Python's powerful built-in data structures, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and learn how to manipulate them efficiently. These are particularly useful tools for scientific analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become a powerhouse for scientific analysis due to its versatility, extensive ecosystem of libraries, and ease of use. Clear syntax and dynamic typing make it accessible to researchers and scientists who may not have a strong programming background, allowing them to quickly translate their ideas into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's scientific computing stack, including libraries like NumPy for numerical computations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization, provides a robust foundation for complex analyses. Additionally, specialized libraries such as SciPy for scientific and technical computing, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Biopython for bioinformatics extend Python's capabilities to various scientific domains. Furthermore, Python's interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks facilitate exploratory data analysis, enabling scientists to document their work, share results, and create reproducible research. This combination of user-friendliness, powerful tools, and a supportive community has made Python a useful tool in fields ranging from physics and astronomy to biology and environmental science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### First things first\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are assuming that you have Python installed\n",
    "- You have familiarity with basic UNIX commands, or at least feel comfortable using them with a reference\n",
    "- We are assuming that you have used Jupyter notebooks, or will be able to install and run it because of the previous two items on this list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Please launch Jupyter Notebooks and navigate to the shared course modules to follow along. Assuming you have previously installed the package, you can simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ jupyter lab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have the package installed, you can do so by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This command uses the Pip Installs Packages command to install Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you would activate what is called a virtual environment, which can be thought of as a container for installing and managing packages efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "The first \"venv\" tells Python to activate a virtual environment, and the second \"venv\" names the environment, so the last word in the above command is arbitrary and up to you. Finally the virtual environment must be activated using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ source insert/path/to/venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to run the first command above \"jupyter lab\"! \n",
    "\n",
    "### The simplest program\n",
    "\n",
    "We might think of a simple program as something that does some math operation or gives us some bit of information, but even simpler than that would be the print() statement. In order to monitor programs we build using code, we have to build in statements that will show in the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the print() function is used to display information on the screen, making it one of the most commonly used functions in the language. A basic print() statement takes one or more arguments and outputs them as text. For example, print(\"Hello, world!\") will display the string \"Hello, world!\" in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it: \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a Python kearnel in Jupyter notebook and type:\n"

    "Computers - as we have previously observerd - aren't terribly smart. While we are able to represent information like \"Hello\" and \"3.14159\", it's pretty clear that the things we might do with the value of Pi and a greeting are pretty different. It's hard to divide two strings, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to remove the apostrophies from an integer. In fact, internally, Python has the ability to represent these data very differently. Each kind of data is called a \"Type\". Soon, we will work directly with types, but the important thing to know for now is that they exist, and that every kind of data is of a \"Type\". Here are the basics (and, in parenthesis, some synonyms/similar types):\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer (int, long)\n",
    "Float (double)\n",
