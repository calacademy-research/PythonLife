    "## What are you going to learn? \n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to learn basic UNIX commands that allow you to manage your computer and run code. Although this course will not cover Python code itself, we will begin to understand why using the UNIX shell is an essential first-step in making use of all sorts of coding languages, including Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An opening note about names\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer folks throw around a lot of linguistic shorthand. A few that you've likely already seen are \"linux\", \"unix\", \"binary\", \"path\", etc. Without going into the etymology of the language, it's important to know that some of these are synonyms. Here are some notable examples:\n",
    "* Linux ←→ UNIX. (Linux is effectively a dialect of UNIX)\n",
    "* Binary ←→ program.\n",
    "* program ←→ executable.\n",
    "* shell ←→ command line.\n",
    "* terminal ←→ shell. (Terminal is the program in which the shell runs)\n",
    "* bash ←→ shell. (BASH is a kind of shell)\n",
    "* unix ←→ *nix. (*nix means 'any dialect of unix'. MacOS is a *nix!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the UNIX shell\n",
    "The shell allows you to move and copy files, run programs, and more. We will focus on the shell today. The UNIX shell environment, which is often called the terminal, is essential to managing and running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open you terminal it will start a Bash UNIX shell, where Bash is the particular flavour of UNIX shell. Within this shell, you can navigate through your computer's folders, read and create files, and run programs. Many bioinformatics programs run exclusively in the shell. There are also other shells like the Apple specific zshrc.**(*?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use the shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash is a powerful language in its own right, and we will only scratch the surface of it today, but we will understand the basics of navigating the shell and managing your files with it. Today's introduction covers bash commands useful for both this course and future use of complex bioinformatics programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large fraction of what you can do in the shell (also called the \"command line\") can be done using GUI based operating system that you're used to (Windows, Mac, and some LINUX). While for the simplest of tasks, the command line may seem like a step backwards. But for anything even mildly more complicated (for example, \"move every file with 2012 anywhere in its name to the folder Backup\"), it can save a lot of time. And then there are the programs that can only be run from the command line, which are much easier to write and more flexible in what they can do.\n",
    "We always use a shell to run python code - for example using a .py file, or indirectly, by launching an interactive Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, first on the agenda is a crash course on bash, which will also prove useful when running other largely UNIX based bioinformatics software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Informative Interlude: Formatting of the lessons for this course\n",
    "For this and all further examples, a $ represents your shell prompt, followed by the commands to type at the prompt. The text below will be used for output you should see when you take the described action.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ command argument1 argument2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving around different folders\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the basic concepts is that your shell is always based somewhere in the directory structure.\n",
    "An analogy here is if you have only a single window open (e.g. the directory browser in Windows/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### pwd - Print Working Directory\n",
    ">*Where am I?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Prints the directory in which you are at the current moment. If you create any files, they will appear in this spot. When you first open the terminal shell, you will be in your \"home\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "/home/jdoe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### cd - Change Directory \n",
    ">*Move to a new directory*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a path, this command moves your \"current location\" to the specified directory.\n",

    "\n",

    "/home/jdoe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, these have been relative paths (i.e. relative to your current directory), but you can also use an absolute path (which will start with a /):\n",

    "Directories in UNIX are set up the same way as your regular computer. Just as you would open up a window into your directories and click to open up folders, here you use cd to go through the directories. You are just typing the command instead of clicking.\n",

    "\n",
    ">*displays the contents of a file*\n",
    "\n",
    "**less** shows the contents of a file, and allows you to scroll and search the contents. A historical note and memory aid - it used to be that there was only **cat**, a command that printed a file to the screen (well, to standard output, but we'll get to that later). That worked well for short files, but for longer files it was nice to stop after a screen full of information, and to prompt for **more**. So, the utility was called, straigtforwardly, **more**. A more sophisticated **more** which allowed for searching and filtering was released so, of course, it's called **less**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**less** can only be used for simple text files, so you cannot reliably view contents of, say, MS Word documents with **less**. Fortunately, most of the files we will be dealing with will be plain text files. Want to know what a file is? Use the command **file**; the system will give you its best guess.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\*nix systems have a notion called \"streams\". These represent a flow of data from one 'thing' to another. A data source is typically a program - like 'ls' or 'cat'. A destination can be a file, the screen, or both. A \"redirect\" is just a chevron (\">\"), and that's used to send a stream to a file. You've already done that - you had a program called \"echo\" create a stream with the contents \"Hello World\". Then, you used a redirect to send the contents of that stream to a file called hello.txt. Note that the redirect command will create a new file. If there's already a file with that name, said file will be overwritten. If you'd like to append a stream to the end of a file, use \">>\", a.k.a. \"append\".\n",
