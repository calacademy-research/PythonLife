    "\n",
    "The **if** statement is one of the most fundamental components of programming, and it is found in some form or another in every general-purpose programming language (and nearly all specialized ones, too). It simply tells the computer to execute a block of code if a given statement is true. If the statement is false, the code is skipped. Although the concept is simple, conditional statements like if allow your programs to make decisions on their own.\n",

    "    DO_THIS_INSTEAD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax mirrors our native language of \"if A, then B, or else C\" statements. For example, \"If you have your car then you should drive, or else I'll drive.\" Our language and Python both start with **if**. The condition, \"A\", must be a statement that evaluates to **True** or **False**. \"Then\" is represented by the colon **:**. The lines of code to be conditionally executed, \"B\" and \"C\", are denoted by indenting them, similar to how we indent code within a funciton. While it is common in English to say \"or else\", just using \"else\" is also correct but sounds archiac and formal. In Python we use just **else** both because it saves us typing and because **or** has a special function that we will discuss later.\n",

But what if we actually had a zero balance in our checking accounts, and thus had no money to exchange for noodles? (Don't worry, you can always steal cookies at the departmental seminar.) We've accounted for all positive values with our above logic, but we've left an implicit assumption that having \\$0 or less on our checking account balance still results in our eating ramen this week. The point: we often make oversights that python will not overlook. These can result in interesting, though nonsensical outcomes -- like getting ramen for nothing.
