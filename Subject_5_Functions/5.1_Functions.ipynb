After that, the function does its thing, executing the indented block of code immediately below the __def__. In this case, it calculates the square of x. The last thing that it does is return that value to the rest of the program.\n",

These are handy, obviously, but they're also a little clumsy - one of the nice things about funcitons is that when they're well conceived, they are self contained. When they reference variables that aren't passed as arguments, then it's harder to know what they're doing. Generally speaking, \"global\" variables aren't a good idea inside of any project that is more than a few dozen lines. And, sadly, one never knows when a project will grow from a tiny steed into a large project, so it's a good idea to program with as few globals as possible. \n",
