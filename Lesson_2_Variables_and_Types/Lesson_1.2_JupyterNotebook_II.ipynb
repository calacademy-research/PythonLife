    "## Jupyter Notebook Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to teach much of the class.  While there are many ways to write and execute Python code, Jupyter Notebooks are a useful tool, both for learning Python and for writing your own data analysis scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is that they provide you with an environment in which you can develop python programs in small chunks (called cells).  The cells can easily be run, modified, and re-run, which is very helpful when trying to fix problems in your code, or when just experimenting with Python in general.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the output of each cell is embedded in the notebook, right underneath the code, for a nice resulting presentation.  Text, and even images and plots, can all be embedded in the notebook, allowing for the easy creation of a nice data-analysis workflow with results and the code that produced the results side-by-side.\n",

    "#### Creating a New Notebook\n",
    "To create a new notebook, click the \"New\" button in the top-right area of the page after the web-browser launches.  Select \"Python 2\" from the list. Let's give the notebook a better title.  At the top of the page, next to the Jupyter logo, click \"Untitled\" and change the title to \"First_Notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running a cell\n",
    "In the first cell, type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to run the cell, hold SHIFT and press ENTER (you also may click the \"run\" button above in the menu).  You'll see the text \"Hello World!\" below the first cell, and a second, empty cell is created for you below.  You can also create new cells yourself by using the \"Insert\" menu at the top of the page, or clicking the **+** icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional: Saving a Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, folks run code directly from the Jupyter Notebook. However, it is also useful to run Python code directly from the command line - e.g. this code is part of a larger pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second cell, type this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%writefile hello_world.py\n",
    "print \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **%%writefile** is a 'magic' function, functions that mean special things to the Jupyter Notebook itself understands. In this case, **%%writefile** saves all the text below the **%%writefile** command (limited, of course, to the cell itself), in this case to **hello_world.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've created your first Python program!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Script from a bash shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Python scripts can be run from the UNIX shell. To run our **hello_world.py** file, open a new terminal (our original terminal is still busy running Jupyter Notebook), use \"cd\" to navigate to your ~/PythonLife/Lesson_1_Unix_and_Jupyter directory, and then run the script using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python hello_world.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other UNIX commands, python scripts can take additional arguments as inputs. In fact, many scripts require additional input, such as a file or a sequence of nucleotides. If you aren't sure, look at the script itself - hopefully the author has comments on how it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the Greet_User.py script in the 1.1 folder using less (you can do this in your bash shell or in Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ less Greet_User.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to put a commented header on all of your scripts - Here, it is the lines between the triple quotes (''') - more on these later! Here, we declared the name of the script, and its inputs (it takes a name). It also gives a brief description of the script for easy reference later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quit out of the less command, type 'q' at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Greet_User.py (END) q\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script, I can pass it a name as an argument:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python Greet_User.py JaneDoe\n",
    "Greetings JaneDoe!\n",
    "```"
