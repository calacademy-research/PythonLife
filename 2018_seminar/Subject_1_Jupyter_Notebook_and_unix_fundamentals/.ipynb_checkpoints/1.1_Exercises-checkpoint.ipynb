    "Normally, we ask that you work on these excersises from a Jupyter Notebook. However, most of the below deal with bash commands, so make a new text file with your favorite text editor that keeps track of the commands you ran to complete the excersise. TextEdit on Macs, Gedit on Ubunu, Notepad on Windows all work well. Even Microsoft Word will work if you have it.\n",

    "### 1) Greetings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Greet_User.py script to greet 3 different users and save the output to a single file called greetings.txt. This file should contain the output of the 3 different greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Someone else's code\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the two scripts Rev_Comp.py and Get_Fasta_Seq.py using less (or your favorite text editor). Both have a commented section similar to the Greet_User.py script, and have examples of how to run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Use the Rev_Comp.py script to find the reverse complement of the sequence AATTGGCC. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) Use the Get_Fasta_Seq.py to find the sequence of the 3rd chromosome (named chrIII) of the Yeast_Genome.fasta file. Save the result to a file called chrIII.seq\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Good old wc\n",
    "\n",
    "Look up the man page for the 'wc' command. Use the wc command and the chrIII.seq file to determine the number of nucleotides on the 3rd chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you do this without first creating the chrIII.seq file?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Bulding a pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Rev_Comp.py and Get_Fasta_Seq.py scripts to generate the reverse complement of the 3rd chromosome (chrIII) of the Yeast_Genome.fasta file in a single line using a pipe. Save the result to a file called chrIII_revcomp.seq. Check your result using wc on both files to determine if they are the same length. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Star-Struck\n",
    "\n",
    "Use wc or ls (or a combination of both or even more) along with appropiate wild-card characters (\\*) to do the following within the 1.1 folder. Record the commands used, and the computer should count, not you!\n",
    "\n",
    "A) List all text (.txt) files\n",
    "\n",
    "B) List all files starting with the letter 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "C) List all files within the Notes folder\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Count the number of characters in the pythons_of_the_world.txt file\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Count the number of lines in each text (.txt) file \n",
    "\n",
    "F) Count the number of files/folders within the 1.1 folder \n",
    "\n",
    "G) Count the number of files starting with the letter 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "H) Count the total number of characters in all files within the 1.1 folder (should be a single number)\n",
    "\n",
    "I) Count the total number of lines in all text (.txt) files within the 1.1 folder (should be a single number)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Wait, you said this wouldn't be on the test!\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the \"Other Useful Commands\" section of the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "A) Count number of chromosomes in the whole yeast genome file using commands from the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) Determine the total size of the genome in base-pairs (FASTA header lines don't count!)\n",
    "\n",
    "C) CHALLENGE. Count the number of times a line in pythons_of_the_world.txt starts with 'Python.' How many times is 'python' the second word in the line? The third?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Moving beyond the lecture\n",
    "Use Google and any other references you want to find a command that tells you how much disk space you have left. Use the 'man' command to see how it works. How much space is left on your system? Find the option that makes the command output in terms of gigabytes and megabytes-- 'human-readable' form.\n"
