    "\n",
    "### 1) Get comfortable with new data structures (adapted from Learning Python)\n",
    "Type the commands below. Add comments to your script describing what is happening in each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]\n",
    "print L\n",
    "print L[:]\n",
    "print L[:0]\n",
    "print L[-2]\n",
    "print L[-2:]\n",
    "\n",
    "L.reverse()\n",
    "print L\n",
    "\n",
    "L.sort()\n",
    "print L\n",
    "\n",
    "idx = L.index(4)\n",
    "print idx\n",

    "### 2) Fun with numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're going to get some practice with lists by writing a few functions to do some basic math operations on lists of numbers.  Later in the week, we'll learn about a python *module* called numpy that has all of this and more built-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Write a function that multiplies two lists of numbers together **\n",
    "\n",
    "It should take, as input arguments, two lists\n",
    "It should return a new list, where each element comes from multiplying the two corresponding elements in the input lists together\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "# bunch of code to generate \"out\"\n",
    "print out #prints [5, 12, 21, 32, 45]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the median**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't forget about the 'sort' function - it will be useful here*\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [3, 53, 57, 23, 41]\n",
    "# bunch of code to generate \"out\"\n",
    "print out #prints 41\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Write a function that filters an input list of numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "It'll have 3 arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the list of numbers to filter.  \n",
    "2. lower bound\n",
    "3. the upper-bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the function should return a new list, containing only elements from the original list that were greater than (or equal to) the lower bound and less than (or equal to) the upper bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "lower = 2\n",
    "upper = 6\n",
    "# bunch of code to generate \"out\"\n",
    "print out # prints [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) A list of lists\n",
    "You want to store the results of three different time series experiments, each with four data points. You should do this by creating a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    run1: 2,3,5,5\n",
    "    run2: 2,2,4,5\n",
    "    run3: 3,3,4,6\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Create an empty list and create a list for each of the 3 runs. Use the append function 3 times to generate the list of lists. Finally, print out the list of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Write a function that will loop through these lists and give us the min, mean, and max. The output should be tab delimited and look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <run number>   <min>   <mean>   <max>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) List transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that will compute the *transpose* of a list of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder:  A transpose means that `new_list[x][y]` = `old_list[y][x]`.  In other words, rows becomes columns and columns become rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_list = [\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "    [5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now output list is:\n",
    "#  [\n",
    "#    [1, 5],\n",
    "#    [2, 6],\n",
    "#    [3, 7],\n",
    "#    [4, 8]\n",

    "log10(probability of a) + log10(probability of a) ... total of 4 times which is\n",

    "1. add \"import math\" at the tope of the code\n",
    "2. use math.log10(number) to get the log10 of a number\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact? This is kind of how we can determine the probability of a sequence occuring by chance. Given a prior set of nucleotide probabilities, usually assumed to be .25 each, we can find the probability of a sequence occurring by multiplying the probabilities of each base in the sequence. Since multiplying small numbers many times can lead to a number too small to compute, we can just add the log of the probabilities to bypass this problem.\n"
