    "\n",
    "\\*nix systems have a notion called \"streams\". These represent a flow of data from one 'thing' to another. A data source is typically a program - like 'ls' or 'cat'. A destination can be a file, the screen, or both. A \"redirect\" is just a chevron (\">\"), and that's used to send a stream to a file. You've already done that - you had a program called \"echo\" create a stream with the contents \"Hello World\". Then, you used a redirect to send the contents of that stream to a file called hello.txt. Note that the redirect command will create a new file. If there's already a file with that name, said file will be overwritten. If you'd like to append a stream to the end of a file, use \">>\", a.k.a. \"append\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the \"echo\" command by itself. If you don't redirect the stream, it defaults to the \"default\" stream which is - guess what? the screen itself."
